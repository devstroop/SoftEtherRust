## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Medium Priority

#### DEBT-5: Missing Integration Tests for Multi-Connection *(Fixed)*

**Status:** RESOLVED - Added 28 unit tests covering multi-connection logic.

**Test Coverage Added:**
| Module | Tests | Coverage |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `multi_connection.rs` | 17 | TcpDirection, ConnectionStats, round-robin, extraction |
| `concurrent_reader.rs` | 11 | ReceivedPacket, shutdown flags, bytes tracking |

**Tested Scenarios:**
- TcpDirection parsing from server (0=Both, 1=S2C, 2=C2S)
- Half-connection mode direction assignment
- Connection distribution for 4 and 8 connections
- Round-robin send/recv selection
- Connection extraction for ConcurrentReader
- Per-connection RC4 cipher independence
- Pack format for additional_connect method
- Shutdown flag propagation across tasks
- Connection index preservation

---

#### DEBT-6: Windows TUN Incomplete
**Location:** `src/adapter/windows.rs`

Missing DNS configuration and route cleanup on drop.

---

### Low Priority

#### DEBT-2: Large File - ffi/client.rs (2727 lines) *(Intentional Design)*

**Status:** Closed - intentional architectural split. FFI layer has different I/O model (callbacks vs TUN). Shared logic already extracted to `TunnelCodec`, `DhcpClient`, `ConnectionManager`.

---

#### DEBT-1: Large File - tunnel/runner.rs (2219 lines) *(Fixed)*

**Status:** RESOLVED - Split into multiple focused modules.

**Original File:** 2219 lines

**New Structure:**
| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `runner.rs` | 329 | Core TunnelRunner struct, entry points, routes |
| `dhcp_handler.rs` | 384 | DHCP handling (single + multi-connection) |
| `single_conn.rs` | 697 | Single-connection data loop (Unix + Windows) |
| `multi_conn.rs` | 659 | Multi-connection data loop (half-connection mode) |
| `packet_processor.rs` | 209 | Shared packet processing utilities |

Each file now has a single responsibility and is under 700 lines.

---

#### DEBT-7: Multiple `unwrap()` in TLS Config *(Fixed)*
**Location:** `src/client/connection.rs:202-244`

**Status:** RESOLVED - Replaced 4 `unwrap()` calls with proper `?` operator and `map_err()` to convert rustls errors to `Error::Tls`.

**Changes:**
- All 4 `with_safe_default_protocol_versions().unwrap()` calls now use `.map_err(|e| Error::Tls(...))?`
- Errors now propagate with descriptive message: "Failed to set TLS protocol versions: {error}"

---

#### DEBT-8: Duplicated Auth Pack Logic *(Fixed)*
**Location:** `src/protocol/auth.rs`

**Status:** RESOLVED - Refactored `new()` and `new_ticket()` to use `add_client_fields()`.

**Changes:**
- `AuthPack::new()`: Replaced ~75 lines of inline code with call to `add_client_fields()`
- `AuthPack::new_ticket()`: Replaced ~70 lines of inline code with call to `add_client_fields()`
- All 5 constructors now consistently use the shared helper function
- File reduced from 978 → 872 lines (~106 lines removed)

---

## 📈 Performance

### Medium Priority

#### PERF-1: Buffer Pool for Receive Allocations *(Fixed)*
**Location:** `src/client/concurrent_reader.rs`

**Status:** RESOLVED - Implemented `BufferPool` using pre-allocated `BytesMut` buffers.

**Implementation:**
- `BufferPool` struct with channel-based buffer recycling
- Pre-allocates `BUFFERS_PER_READER * num_connections + channel_size` buffers
- Reader tasks grab from pool, read directly into `BytesMut`, freeze to `Bytes` (zero-copy)
- `try_reclaim()` method recycles `Bytes` back to `BytesMut` when sole owner
- Stats tracking: `pool_stats()` returns (hits, misses, hit_rate%)
- Graceful degradation: allocates new buffer when pool empty

**Before:** `Bytes::copy_from_slice(&buf[..n])` - allocation per packet
**After:** `buf.freeze()` - zero-copy conversion from pooled BytesMut

---

#### PERF-6: Upload Path Throttling and Latency Oscillation *(Fixed)*
**Location:** `src/client/multi_connection.rs`

**Status:** RESOLVED - Implemented least-loaded connection selection and removed blocking flushes.

**Root Causes:**
1. Round-robin selection didn't consider TCP buffer pressure
2. `flush().await` after every write blocked on TCP ACKs
3. No load balancing across send connections

**Fixes:**
- Added `pending_send_bytes` tracking with time-based decay (~10 MB/s assumed)
- `get_send_connection()` now selects least-loaded connection
- Removed explicit `flush()` calls (TCP_NODELAY ensures immediate send)
- Added `record_write()` to track per-connection send load
- Added `estimated_pending()` with automatic decay calculation

---

### Low Priority

#### PERF-2: Redundant Compression Check
**Location:** `src/tunnel/runner.rs`

Called for every packet even when compression is disabled.

**Recommendation:** Check `use_compress` flag first.

---

#### PERF-3: RC4 Batch Processing
**Location:** `src/crypto/rc4.rs`

Single buffer at a time. Batching could reduce overhead.

---

#### PERF-4: Fragment Reassembly HashMap Growth
**Location:** `src/packet/fragment.rs`

HashMap grows unbounded until cleanup. Use `with_capacity()`.

---

#### PERF-5: JNI String Allocations
**Location:** `src/ffi/android.rs`

Multiple allocations when copying from JNI. Consider stack buffers.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### ✅ Positive Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Zero-copy networking | `bytes::Bytes` and slice references throughout |
| Modular crypto | SHA-0, RC4, ChaCha20-Poly1305 in separate modules |
| Platform abstraction | `TunAdapter` trait for cross-platform TUN |
| Good test coverage | Most packet/protocol modules have unit tests |
| Clear separation | protocol/, packet/, net/, client/, ffi/ |
| Concurrent reader | Channel-based concurrent TCP reader |

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| FFI/Desktop split | Two implementations instead of shared core |
| Large files | ~~runner.rs (2247)~~ and client.rs (2725) - runner.rs split, client.rs intentional |
| Error propagation | Mix of `Result`, `Option`, and panics |
| State machine clarity | Connection states could use proper FSM pattern |

## ✅ Recently Fixed

- [x] **PERF-6: Upload Path Throttling** (Jan 2026) - Replaced round-robin send selection with least-loaded connection selection using `pending_send_bytes` tracking. Removed blocking `flush()` calls that caused latency oscillation. TCP_NODELAY ensures immediate transmission. Added 7 tests (test count 154 → 161).
- [x] **PERF-1: Buffer Pool for Receive Allocations** (Jan 2026) - Implemented `BufferPool` in `concurrent_reader.rs` using pre-allocated `BytesMut` buffers. Reader tasks grab from pool, read directly, freeze to `Bytes` (zero-copy). Includes `try_reclaim()` for buffer recycling and stats tracking. Added 9 new tests (test count 145 → 154).
- [x] **DEBT-8: Duplicated Auth Pack Logic** (Jan 2026) - Refactored `AuthPack::new()` and `AuthPack::new_ticket()` to use `add_client_fields()` helper. All 5 auth constructors now share common code. File reduced from 978 → 872 lines (~106 lines removed).
- [x] **DEBT-7: Multiple `unwrap()` in TLS Config** (Jan 2026) - Replaced 4 `unwrap()` calls in `create_tls_config()` with proper error handling using `map_err()` to convert rustls errors to `Error::Tls`. Errors now propagate correctly instead of panicking.
- [x] **DEBT-5: Missing Integration Tests for Multi-Connection** (Jan 2026) - Added 28 unit tests: 17 in `multi_connection.rs` (TcpDirection, ConnectionStats, round-robin, half-connection distribution, RC4 independence) and 11 in `concurrent_reader.rs` (ReceivedPacket, bytes tracking, shutdown flags, connection index preservation). Test count increased from 118 to 145.
- [x] **DEBT-1: Large File - tunnel/runner.rs** (Jan 2026) - Split into 5 modules: `runner.rs` (329 lines), `dhcp_handler.rs` (384 lines), `single_conn.rs` (697 lines), `multi_conn.rs` (659 lines), `packet_processor.rs` (209 lines). Each module has a single responsibility.
- [x] **DEBT-3: Duplicated Data Loop Code** (Jan 2026) - Created `src/tunnel/packet_processor.rs` with shared utilities (`init_arp`, `send_keepalive_if_needed`, `send_periodic_garp_if_needed`, `send_pending_arp_reply`, `send_frame_encrypted`, `build_ethernet_frame`). Updated both `run_data_loop_unix` and `run_data_loop_windows` to use shared functions, eliminating ~60 lines of duplication.
- [x] **DEBT-4: Inconsistent FFI Error Handling** (Jan 2026) - Added `softether_get_last_error()` and `softether_clear_last_error()` FFI functions. Thread-local storage holds detailed error message on failure. Updated `softether_create()` to set specific error messages (e.g., "config is null", "server is null or invalid UTF-8").
- [x] **ISSUE-7: ARP Array Index Panic** (Jan 2026) - **Closed as safe code.** Line 201 validates `frame.len() >= 42` before any access. The slice `[arp_start+8..arp_start+14]` = `[22..28]` only needs indices 0-27, well within the 42-byte minimum. The `unwrap()` is unreachable.
- [x] **ISSUE-6: Password Hash Panic** (Jan 2026) - **Closed as safe code.** The `unwrap()` at line 524 is preceded by explicit length validation (lines 518-523) that returns `Error::Config` if not 20 bytes. The `unwrap()` is unreachable on invalid input.
- [x] **ISSUE-4: DHCP Response Race** (Jan 2026) - **Closed as works-as-designed.** FFI does DHCP on single bidirectional connection before additional connections. Desktop establishes all connections before DHCP. No race condition possible.
- [x] **ISSUE-8: UDP Accel Session Not Closed** (Jan 2026) - **Closed as works-as-designed.** Official SoftEther `FreeUdpAccel()` also relies on socket close + server keepalive timeout (9s). No explicit close packet in protocol.
- [x] **ISSUE-5: Thread-Local Storage in iOS FFI** (Jan 2026) - Changed `softether_ios_get_session()` and `softether_ios_get_stats()` to use caller-provided buffers instead of thread-local storage. Prevents stale data across threads and pointer invalidation. API now consistent with other iOS helper functions.
- [x] **ISSUE-3: Missing Timeout on Additional Connection** (Jan 2026) - Wrapped `establish_one_additional()` with `tokio::time::timeout()` using `config.timeout_seconds`. Prevents hanging if server accepts TCP but never responds to handshake.
- [x] **ISSUE-2: Frame Split Across Multi-Connections** (Jan 2026) - **Closed as not a bug.** Analysis of official SoftEther source (Connection.c) confirms each TCP socket has independent `RecvFifo` and frame parsing state. Server sends complete frames to individual connections (never splits across connections). Per-connection `TunnelCodec` is correct.
- [x] **ISSUE-1: RC4 Stream Corruption** (Jan 2026) - Implemented per-connection RC4 cipher state. Each `ManagedConnection` now has its own `TunnelEncryption` instance, matching server's per-socket encryption model. Files: `multi_connection.rs`, `concurrent_reader.rs`, `runner.rs`
- [x] **Config layer restructure** (Jan 2026) - Authentication moved to nested `auth` object with method selection (password, RADIUS, cert, anonymous)
- [x] **Marvin Attack** (RUSTSEC-2023-0071) - Hardened RSA fork
- [x] **Digest conflict** - Updated sha1 to 0.11.0-rc.3
